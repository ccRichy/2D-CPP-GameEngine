If we need performance, we can stop rendering the full-sized window-scale buffer, and force a smaller one

#todo, elaborate this more but just start with some obvious stuff


GENERAL
1. The program compiles 2 cpp files for the platform/application layers respectively.
Each platform is compiled distinctly, separated by their respective 'main' files. 
I also use a 0 Header-Guard, Unity-Build method for keep #includes, compile times to a minimum. See below for elaboration.

2. Another philosophy of the program is single source of truth wherever can be reasonable/possible.
A number of structs have default values at declaration to avoid separation.

3. Everything that needs to be compiled for both the platform and the game should be included in "game.h" (real generic stuff like math, arrays, strings, etc)

4. This project considers .cpp files to be any files with implementation details.
This does not rule out the file possibly containing definitions as well.
The project uses plently that contain both for "find" (Ctrl + F) purposes, and to keep our compilation time down.
Rule of thumb, if it's going to include a function body, then make it a .cpp file.



DEBUG
1. Errors. In the shipped game (Release Build if you will), a crash upon error should be as infrequent as possible. See example below. 
Ex: If a Sprite's file data is invalid, we use a debug sprite. This is enforced in the macro function "sprite_set()" Not only to make the developer aware of an issue, but also as a failsafe to the Player.




Q: Unity-Build?
A: Instead of the standard C/C++ compilation of each file becoming its own compilation unit, instead, all source files end up as includes in the respective 'main' file.
This goes for the platform and the application. What this does is keep our compilation times down, and in my opinion, rules out the need of a build system.

Q: 0 Header-Guard?
A: This is a method to keep all of our #include's down to 1.
Since header-guards are there to prevent redefinitions, removing it will show us at compile time if the file is included in multiple places.
